# Connect 4

Connect Four (also known as Connect 4, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.

# How to play

In this my version of Connect 4, the user plays against the computer and the tokens are replaced by letters: 'R' as red and 'Y' as yellow.
User is player 1 (R) and computer is player 2 (Y).
User is prompted to choose a column number for dropping his/her letter and the computer randomly provides a column number for dropping its.
The game will run until someone makes 4 in a row.
