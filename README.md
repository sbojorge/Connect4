# Connect 4

Connect 4 is a logic and strategy game played with a grid of 7 columns and 6 rows (42 quadrants available). Each player, usually 2, has 21 tiles to play.

The objective is to complete a segment of 4 tiles in a row on the grid, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The first is to achieve it is the winner.

The tiles can be placed on the grid only at the top of it. It means that the main axis of the game are the columns and that the first positions or quadrants to fill will be those of the lower row. The grid will be then filled from top to bottom.

Players should choose carefully column to drop the tile and will allow them to complete 4 in a row while placing checkers to block their opponent and thus prevent him from winning.
